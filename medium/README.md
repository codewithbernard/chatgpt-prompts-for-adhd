Ever felt like your brain is a browser with 47 tabs open, all playing different music at once?

After years of struggling with ADHD and trying countless productivity hacks, I discovered something game-changing: ChatGPT isn't just another AI tool â€“ it's like having a personal ADHD coach in your pocket. Through months of experimentation, I've crafted a set of prompts that actually work with our unique brain wiring, not against it.

In this guide, I'll share the exact prompts that have helped me (and hundreds of others in my ADHD support group) transform chaos into clarity. Whether you're diagnosed with ADHD or just feeling overwhelmed by life's demands, these practical prompts will help you build a system that finally clicks with your brain.

Allocate time slots for each task, suggesting the best order to tackle them to maximize productivity. Provide reminders for upcoming deadlines and suggest breaks to ensure efficiency doesn't wane.
